Requirements
------------

The library itself does not require external resources. Optional configure
flags require external resources:

 --enable-doc                  requires doxygen and latex.
 --enable-rohc-stats           requires libpcap, gnuplot, grep, sed, awk, sort,
                               and tr.
 --enable-rohc-tests           requires libpcap, and sed.
 --enable-rohc-tests-valgrind  requires --enable-rohc-tests to be selected,
                               valgrind, xsltproc, and grep.


Libraries and tools
-------------------

Configure the libraries and tools:

 $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/installation/directory

 Note:
  - Use ./autogen.sh instead of ./configure if you are building from the source
    repository.
  - Add option --enable-examples if you want ot build the examples located in
    the examples/ directory.

Build the libraries and tools:

 $ make all

Install the libraries and tools:

 $ make install

The libraries are now located in the /path/to/installation/directory/lib
directory, the header files in the /path/to/installation/directory/include
directory and the tools in the /path/to/installation/directory/bin directory.

In case of problem:
 - check you got the last release of the library (see README),
 - contact the mailing list (see README),
 - check the bugtracker for known bugs (see README).


Documentation
-------------

HTML documentation can be generated from the source code thanks to Doxygen:

 $ ./configure --enable-doc
 $ make html

Open the ./doc/html/index.html file in your favorite web browser.


Tests
-----

The functional, robustness and non-regression tests may be run:

 $ ./configure --enable-rohc-tests
 $ make check

Add option --enable-rohc-tests-valgrind if you want to run tests within
valgrind.


Statistic tool
--------------

A HTML summary of compression statistics may be generated:

 $ ./configure --enable-rohc-stats
 $ make -C statistics check

Open the ./statistics/html/index.html file in your favorite web browser.


Developers
-----------

Developers may be interested in additional configure options:
  --enable-fail-on-warning  causes the build to fail if a warning is emitted
                            by the compiler (-Werror)
  --enable-fortify_sources  enables some protections (-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2)
