21 Oct 2012 - release 1.5.0
  Compatibility:
    Version 1.5.0 is not compatible with versions < 1.5.0 because of several
    fixes related to IETF RFCs that change the format of ROHC packets.
    The library API is however compatible with earlier versions.
  License/Authors:
    Add FWX for his ESP profile.
    Change website URI for http://rohc-lib.org/
  Acknowledgments for bug reports and/or bug fixes:
    Ahmed Fathy, Arne, Audric Schiltknecht, FWX, Keith Harry, Mikhail Gruzdev,
    qingbaibai, Viveris Technologies.
  Main changes:
    Support for FreeBSD and Microsoft Windows (through MinGW) systems.
    Better support for ARM and PowerPC platforms.
    Enhance stream classifier efficiency: use next header to classify streams
      for IP-only profile.
    Handle context re-use gracefully.
    Do our best not to alter the decompression context before we are sure the
      packet could be successfully decompressed.
    Do not force the transmission of several IR-DYN packets when dynamic
      fields changed. Packets of type UOR-2* may also be used.
    Make sure IP-ID bits located in base headers are always for the innermost
      IPv4 header with non-random IP-ID, except if stated otherwise.
    Fix the disambiguation algorithm for RTP UOR-2* packets.
    Handle TS wraprounds as stated in RFC 4815.
    New API for user to specify a callback that generates random numbers.
    New API for user to configure the size of the WLSB window.
    New API for user to configure the timeouts for periodic refreshes.
    New API for user to configure the CID type and the MAX_CID value.
    Deprecate rohc_decompress_both() API function.
    Remove the jamming algorithm (because of bad implementation).
    The test_performance app is now installed by make install.
  Build system:
    Add inter-library dependencies.
    Use library versioning through libtool.
    Check whether the compiler computes bit-field lengths as expected or not
      (added because of TCC).
    Valgrind can be used to check for memory problems while running tests:
      configure option --enable-rohc-tests-valgrind added.
    Rename rohc.c into rohc_common.c to avoid problems when building code for
      Linux kernel.
    Add option --enable-fortify_sources to add -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 to CFLAGS.
    Use the grep, sed, awk, sort, and tr tools found by autoconf in the
      different shell scripts.
    Remove -lm from LDFLAGS, as the library does not use math functions
      anymore.
    Use the newer pcap/pcap.h instead of the deprecated pcap.h include.
    Enable parallel tests.
  Q&A:
    Enhance LSB encoding/decoding test.
    Add several new enums to make code clearer.
    Replace several int by bool.
    Remove useless members in some structs.
    Remove some useless functions from LSB decoding module.
    Make several structs private.
    Make several functions private and static.
    Shorten the names of several variables/functions for better code clarity.
    Add the rohc_dump_packet() function to log the content of a packet.
    Add many const keywords on the function parameters of the ip module.
    Rework the detection of IP-ID behaviour to make code clearer.
    Factorize code with new sdvl_decode() and sdvl_get_min_len() functions.
    Move algorithm for packet type decision into profile-specific files.
    Introduce new get_next_sn() callback for IP-based profiles.
    Introduce new decide_extension() callback for IP-based profiles.
    Split decode_uo*() functions to make them clearer and factorize code.
    New helper functions to clarify code about IPv4 headers and their IP-ID.
    Rework Offset IP-ID decoding module.
    Update Doxygen and INSTALL.
  Performances:
    Remove useless calls to bzero or calloc.
    Optimize memory allocation in the wlsb module.
    Avoid several calls to strlen() in functions that return statistics.
    Remove useless ceil() calls.
    Improve W-LSB speed.
    Allocate the array of decompression contexts to its full size to avoid
      re-allocations during packet processing.
